 Murphy Problem P2.20

## Problem 2 ##

 Sketch an input-output diagram for the combustion of fuel in an automobile. The inputs are gasoline (assume gasoline is 90 vol% octane (C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>18</sub>) and 10 vol% ethanol (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH) and air (assume 21 mol% O<sub>2</sub> and 79 mol% N<sub>2</sub>). Both octane and ethanol burn completely to CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O, and that combustion is complete so there is no excess O<sub>2</sub> in the exhaust stream. Calculate stream flows in mass units (kg/hour) assuming the automobile burns 10 kg/hour of fuel when driving at highway speeds.

a. What additional physical property data will you need? Search for that data, and cite the authoritative source for your information.

b. How many reactions do you need to consider for the material balance?

c. Complete your material balance calculations.
