      "\n",
      "Methanol is a by-product of common pharmaceutical fermentation processes. For the purpose of designing a binary distillation column to strip the methanol from the fermentation broth, construct an x-y diagram using Raoult's law and Antoine's equations for an operating pressure of 97.99 kPa. Plot the experimental data from http://www.ddbst.com/en/EED/VLE/VLE%20Methanol%3BWater.php on the same plot.\n"

      "A 30,000 kg aircraft is to be launched from the deck of an aircraft carrier using a steam catapult. The 100 meter long catapult must accelerate the aircraft to a take-off speed of 80 meters/second. The moving portions of the catapult add 3,000 kg to the accelerate mass. To a rough approximation, all of the energy for the launch comes from a steam catapault. \n",
